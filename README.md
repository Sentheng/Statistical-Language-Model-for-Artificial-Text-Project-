# Statistical-Language-Model-for-Artificial-Text-Project-
#Created a statistical model using MATLAB to read a corpus of text in order to predict the next word in the sequence of given word preceding using a N-gram language modeling system. 
#The model was trained and measured by counting how often word sequences occur and estimating their probabilities for prediction using unigram and bigram
#For this project the text file for Moby Dick was used. 

#There are 10 different function
#1: Function to read the text file
#2: Function to extracting only the words
#3: Function to count the amount of words
#4: Function to count the amount of unique words
#5: Function count the amount of unqiue words under a minimum amount
#6: Function to get the number of occurences of each word (unigram)
#7: Function to get the matrix of the bigram
#8: Function to generate the next text based on probability of the words using prior information
#9: Function to improve automatic text generation by adding constraints
#10: Function to plot the distribution of the words of the book
